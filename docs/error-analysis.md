# Error Analysis

Details coming soon!

In a nutshell: we can generate a synthetic camera spectral response, with a single sensitivity at a given wavelength. We multiply that by the monochromator's measured spectral irradiance to create synthetic pixel values, add some noise, and run `camera_response.py` on it. The results give us a benchmark for the performance of the method.
